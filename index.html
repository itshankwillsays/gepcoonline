<h2>Common Issues When Checking GEPCO Bills Online</h2>
<h2>1. Invalid Reference Number</h2>
<p>One of the most common issues users face is entering an <strong>invalid reference number</strong>. This can happen due to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Typographical errors while entering the number.</li>
  <li>Using an outdated or incorrect reference number from a previous bill.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always double-check the reference number you are entering. It should be a <strong>14-digit number</strong> found on your previous bill, typically located at the top left corner. If you're unsure, refer back to an old bill or contact GEPCO customer service for assistance.</p>
<h2>2. Website Loading Issues</h2>
<p>Sometimes, users may experience slow loading times or unresponsive pages when trying to access the GEPCO online bill check portal.<strong>Solution:</strong> If you encounter loading issues, try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache. Additionally, ensure that your internet connection is stable. If problems persist, consider accessing the site during off-peak hours when traffic may be lower.</p>
<h2>3. Bill Not Available</h2>
<p>Another common issue is receiving a message stating that the <strong>bill is not available</strong> for viewing. This could be due to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The bill not being generated yet for the current month.</li>
  <li>Technical glitches in the GEPCO system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> If your bill is not available, wait a few days and try again. Bills are typically generated monthly, so it's possible that yours hasn't been processed yet. You can also check back later in the month or reach out to GEPCO customer service for clarification.</p>

If you're using a mobile device, consider switching to a desktop for easier access to printing options. Additionally, check if your device has sufficient storage space for downloads.</p>
<h2>5. Security Concerns</h2>
<p>Some users may feel apprehensive about entering personal information online due to security concerns.<strong>Solution:</strong> Always ensure that you are using a secure connection (look for "https" in the URL) when accessing the GEPCO website. Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive transactions and consider using a VPN for added security.</p>
